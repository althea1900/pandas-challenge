As the Chief Data Scientist for the PYcity's school district, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results.  After reviewing every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend.

I have aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

I've created the following tables to show:
- A District Summary (a a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics
- A School Summary (an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school)
- Top 5 Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
- Bottom 5 Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
- Math Scores by Grade (the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school
- Reading Scores by Grade (the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school)
- Scores by School Spending (school performances based on average Spending Ranges per student)
- Scores by School Size (school performances based on school size)
- Scores by School Type (school performance based on school types)


Of the many observable trends based on this data, here are a few that very important:
- Even though all the schools have a very simular bueget per student (~500), the Charter schools out perform the District schools
- The total number of students in the Charter schools is significantly less (~1K to 2K per school) compared to the District shcools (~3K to 4Kper school).
- The schools that have a medium propulation of students (1 to 2 thousand) shows the best student performance
- Adding and additional District school could reduce the student population and raise the districts student performance
